Implement the method int NumberOfPaths(int x, int y) that returns the number of paths
that can be taken to get to position (x,y) from position (0,0). A path is a sequence of points with integer coordinates that satisfy:

1. Two consecutive points have a distance of one unit.
2. The sequence of abscissas and ordinates, taken independently, are non-decreasing and less than or equal to x,y respectively
