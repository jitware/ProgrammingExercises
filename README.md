# Programming Exercises
#### Jitware Community of Italy

### Programming exercises to improve your logic and learn any programming language, with the support of the community.
## Important
We have two folders: **Exercises** and **Exams**, both organized by categories.

## Instructions
Fork the project and work with git to stay updated.

- In the folder of each exercise or exam, you will find a markdown file named README.md with instructions.
- If you want to share your solution to an exercise with the community, create a code file with your name in the corresponding 
folder of the programming language and make a **PULL REQUEST** to the repository.
